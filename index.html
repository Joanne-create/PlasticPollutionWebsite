    <p class="info-1">
        Plastic pollution is the widespread contamination of natural environments by plastic materials that accumulate
        due to human activity. Made from synthetic polymers, plastics are incredibly resilient and designed to withstand
        long periods without decomposing, which contributes to their persistence in the environment. When disposed of
        improperly, plastics are carried by wind and water into various ecosystems. Larger plastics, like bottles and
        bags, can remain for hundreds of years, and over time, these break down into smaller fragments called
        microplastics, which are less than 5 millimeters in size.
    </p>
    <p class="info-2">
        Microplastics have now permeated nearly every corner of the planet, from the depths of the ocean to the peaks of
        remote mountains. Because these materials do not fully biodegrade, they remain in the environment indefinitely,
        creating a continuous cycle of pollution that is extremely difficult to reverse.
    </p>
    <p class="info-3">
        Furthermore, plastic pollution has more than doubled in the last 2 decades because of how cheap, sterile and
        useful it is, as it can be used on many different occasions, making plastic also very versatile. In the 1950s
        barely over two million tons of plastic was produced but in 2019 those numbers reached an astonishing amount of
        450 million tonnes! This ongoing accumulation poses serious challenges to the health of ecosystems, economies,
        and communities.

    <button class="info4-button">How and who invented plastic? ↓ </button>
    <p class="info-4">
        Plastic was invented in the early 20th century as a wonder
        material that could mimic everything from silk to ivory.
        In 1907, Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland created the first fully
        synthetic plastic,Bakelite, which transformed
        manufacturing. Its ability to be molded into any shape,
        while being lightweight and durable, made it revolutionary.
        By the 1950s, plastic production boomed, giving rise to
        products like Tupperware, toys, and household goods..

    <button class="info5-button">The different types of plastic and the most toxic ones ↓ </button>
    <p class="info-5">The most common is polyethylene (PE),
        found in plastic bags, and polypropylene (PP), used in
        bottle caps. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is durable and used
        for pipes and flooring but can release toxic chemicals if
        not disposed of properly. Polystyrene (PS), used for foam
        cups and food containers, can leach harmful substances into
        food. Perhaps the most concerning are polycarbonate (PC)
        and certain forms of PVC, as they contain bisphenol A
        (BPA) and phthalates, which are known to disrupt hormones
        and may pose serious health risks. As we learn more about
        their impact, reducing toxic plastic use becomes crucial for
        our health and the environment.
