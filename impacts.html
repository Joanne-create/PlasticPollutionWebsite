    <p class="info-1">
        Plastic pollution poses significant risks to human health,
        primarily through the release of toxic chemicals.
        As plastic items degrade in landfills, they can leach
        harmful substances like BPA, phthalates, and dioxins into
        the soil and groundwater. When plastics are burned, they
        release toxic fumes that can cause respiratory problems
        and increase the risk of diseases like asthma and cancer.
        Moreover, microplastics have been discovered in the air, drinking water, and even
        in food. These tiny particles can accumulate in the human body over time,
        potentially leading to inflammation, organ damage, and other chronic health issues,
        although the full impact is still being studied.

        Animals, particularly those in marine environments, are
        heavily impacted by plastic pollution. Every year, millions
        of birds, fish, and marine mammals die from ingesting
        plastic waste or getting entangled in discarded plastic
        items like fishing nets and plastic rings. Sea turtles
        often mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish, which
        can block their digestive systems and lead to starvation.
        Even smaller creatures, like plankton, ingest
        microplastics, which then travel up the food chain,
        affecting larger animals and potentially humans. As a
        result, entire ecosystems are at risk as plastic pollution
        disrupts the balance of life in oceans, rivers, and
        coastal areas.

    <p class="info-3">
        Plastic pollution severely impacts the environment by
        contaminating soil, waterways, and oceans. Once plastic
        waste enters ecosystems, it can take hundreds to thousands
        of years to break down, leading to long-lasting damage.
        In landfills, plastics can release chemicals that seep
        into the ground, affecting soil fertility and contaminating
        water sources. In oceans, plastic waste forms massive
        "garbage patches" like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,
        which disrupt marine habitats and kill wildlife.
        As plastics fragment into microplastics, they become
        nearly impossible to remove, permanently altering natural
        environments and threatening both wildlife and human communities
        that depend on clean air, soil, and water.
