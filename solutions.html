    <p class="info"><b class="info-bold">Reducing Single-Use Plastics:</b>
        One of the simplest ways to combat plastic pollution is
        by cutting back on single-use plastics like straws, bags,
        and water bottles. By switching to reusable alternatives—such
        as stainless steel bottles, cloth shopping bags, and metal or
        bamboo straws—we can significantly decrease the amount of waste
        generated daily. Encouraging the use of biodegradable or
        compostable materials in place of traditional plastics can
        also make a big difference.

    <p class="info"><b class="info-bold">Recycling:</b>
        Recycling helps give used plastics a second life
        instead of sending them to landfills or into the ocean.
        However, recycling systems need to be more efficient and
        accessible, with better education on how to properly sort
        materials. Governments can invest in modernizing recycling
        facilities and introducing incentives for individuals and
        companies to recycle more responsibly.

    <p class="info"><b class="info-bold">Plastic alternatives:</b>
        Innovations in materials science are paving
        the way for alternatives like bioplastics,
        which decompose naturally, and packaging
        made from seaweed or mushrooms. These
        solutions can replace traditional plastic
        in everyday items like containers and
        cutlery. Investing in research and
        encouraging industries to adopt these technologies
        is crucial for long-term change.

    <p class="info"><b class="info-bold">Raising awareness:</b>
        Raising awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution
        is essential for fostering a culture of
        environmental responsibility. Programs in
        schools, community cleanups, and campaigns
        like Plastic Free July empower individuals
        to make more informed choices. When people
        understand how their actions affect the
        planet, they are more likely to adopt sustainable
        habits.

        These diverse solutions—ranging from individual lifestyle changes to systemic reforms—work together to tackle
        plastic pollution comprehensively.
